                    <p class="lead">
                        Real vs AI is an image-identification game that challenges your ability to distinguish between authentic photographs and AI-generated images.

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle me-2"></i> What are AI-generated images?</h4>
                        <p>
                            AI-generated images are either completely AI-generated or AI-assisted composite images/photo composites using AI. These images are created using AI models that analyze and manipulate elements from real photographs, combining them into a new visual design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These can involve processes like image stitching, where AI blends parts of various photos together seamlessly. Some AI tools use techniques like style transfer, which overlay artistic elements onto a base image, or image inpainting, which fills in missing parts of photos creatively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such creations retain elements of realism due to the use of real photos but are often modified or augmented to suit specific creative purposes.

                            <h5>How to Play</h5>
                            <p>In Single Player mode, you'll be shown two images side by side - one real and one AI-generated. Your task is to identify which image is the real one.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Difficulty Levels</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Easy:</strong> 20 rounds with 5 lives</li>
                                <li><strong>Medium:</strong> 50 rounds with 3 lives</li>
                                <li><strong>Hard:</strong> 100 rounds with only 1 life</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h5>Scoring</h5>
                            <p>Each correct answer adds 1 point to your score. Each incorrect answer costs you 1 life. The game ends when you run out of lives or complete all rounds.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Bonus Game</h5>
                            <p>In Easy and Medium difficulties, every 10 turns you'll have the option to play a bonus mini-game if you have less than the starting number of lives. The bonus game shows you four images, one of which is real. If you correctly identify it, you gain a life. If you're wrong, you lose half your score (rounded up). You can always choose to skip the bonus game if you prefer.</p>

                            <p>In Multiplayer mode, you compete with friends to see who has the best eye for real vs AI images. The game starts once at least two players have joined.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Look closely at fine details like hair, teeth, and fingers - AI often struggles with these</li>
                        <li>Check for unnatural lighting or shadows that seem off</li>
                        <li>Examine textures and patterns for inconsistencies</li>
                        <li>Look for unusual distortions or warping in the background</li>
                        <li>Trust your instincts - if something looks "off" about an image, it might be AI-generated</li>
                    </ul>
